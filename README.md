# Printer Job Scheduler – DSA Project in C++

## Project Overview
This is a **printer job scheduling system** implemented in **C++**, designed to efficiently manage and process print jobs based on **priority**. It demonstrates practical usage of **data structures and algorithms**, specifically **circular linked lists** and **priority queue logic**.

## Features
- **Circular Linked List** for dynamic and efficient queue management.
- **Priority-based insertion**: higher-priority jobs are processed first.
- Add, delete, search, and view jobs in the queue.
- Track **total jobs processed** and **total pages printed**.
- Persistent storage using **file I/O** (`queue.txt`) to save and load queue data.
- Displays processing time for each operation using **microsecond-level timing**.
- Robust input validation and error handling.

## DSA Concepts Applied
- Circular linked lists
- Priority queue logic
- Dynamic memory management (pointers)
- Algorithmic complexity optimization

## Technologies Used
- C++
- File Handling
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Performance Measurement

## Why This Project Matters
This project applies DSA concepts to real-world problems like job scheduling. It demonstrates:
 - Efficient queue management
 - Priority-based job processing
 - Practical use of dynamic memory and circular linked lists
 - File handling and persistent storage
